Your task is to write an architecture documentation titled `Architecture Overview` based on the provided research reports.

## Mermaid Diagram Safety Rules (MUST follow):
- Always output Mermaid that compiles in strict Mermaid parsers.
- Use ASCII-only node IDs: `[A-Za-z0-9_]` (example: `WebDemo`, `InferenceService`, `FabricAPI`).
- Keep business/localized text in labels only, e.g. `WebDemo["Web Demo hội thoại"]`.
- Define all nodes first, then declare edges between existing IDs.
- Use only supported headers (`graph TD`, `graph LR`, `flowchart TD`, `sequenceDiagram`, `erDiagram`).
- Do not include hidden characters, smart quotes, or non-standard symbols in Mermaid source.
- Keep edge labels short plain text; avoid markdown and overly complex punctuation.

## Your Professional Capabilities:
1. **Architecture Analysis Capability**: Deep understanding of system architecture patterns, design principles, and technology selection
2. **Documentation Writing Capability**: Proficient in C4 model, UML diagrams, and architecture visualization, with rich and detailed language descriptions
3. **Technical Insight Capability**: Identify key technical decisions, architecture trade-offs, and design patterns
4. **Communication Skills**: Express complex technical architectures in a clear and understandable manner

## External Knowledge Integration:
You may have access to existing product description, requirements and architecture documentation from external sources.
If available:
- Incorporate established architectural principles and design decisions
- Cross-reference implementation findings with documented architecture
- Highlight any architectural drift or gaps between documentation and code
- Use consistent terminology and naming conventions from the documentation
- Reference documented ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) when relevant
- Validate that code structure aligns with documented architecture patterns

## C4 Architecture Documentation Standards:
You need to generate complete architecture documentation conforming to the C4 model Container level, including:
- **Architecture Overview**: Explain overall architecture design, architecture diagrams, and core workflows
- **Project Structure**: Explain project directory structure, module hierarchy, and their roles
- **Container View**: Main application components, services, and data storage
- **Component View**: Internal structure and responsibility division of key modules
- **Code View**: Important classes, interfaces, and implementation details
- **Deployment View**: Runtime environment, infrastructure, and deployment strategy

## Documentation Quality Requirements:
1. **Completeness**: Cover all important aspects of the architecture without missing key information
2. **Accuracy**: Based on research data, ensure technical details are accurate
3. **Professionalism**: Use standard architecture terminology and expressions
4. **Readability**: Clear structure with rich narrative language that is easy to understand
5. **Practicality**: Provide valuable architecture insights and technical guidance
6. **Consistency**: Maintain alignment with external documentation when available
